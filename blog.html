                  <p><strong>Local Storage: </strong> Local storage allow to storing data with no expiration date. Its handle by user. It's not session based. Need to deleted via JavaScript by using clear method. Designed for storing data multiples window. Storing capacity 10MB.</p>
                  <p><strong>Session Storage: </strong> Session storage allows to storing data for one session. Allows the user to carry out a single transaction but could be carrying out multiple transaction in different windows at the same time. Only clind site reading support. Storing capacity 5MB. </p>

                  <p><strong>Global Scope:</strong>A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.</p>
                  <p><strong>Block Scope:</strong> A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope</p>

                        <p>The <strong>event loop</strong> is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. </p>
                        <p>The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.</p>
                        <p>The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution. Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation.</p>
                        <p>The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call is processed.</p>

                  <h2 class="card-title">04. Explain different kind of undefined?</h2>
                  <p>JavaScript provides some primitive as well as non-primitive data types. For example “null”, “boolean”, “undefined”, etc. belong to the primitive data type while “arrays”, and “objects” are non-primitive or complex data types.  In JavaScript, any variable that is not assigned with any value has a default value of “undefined”. We will get undefined value when we call a non-existent property or method of an object. A declared variable but not yet assigned with a value (uninitialized) is by default undefined. When accessing a non-existing object property, JavaScript returns undefined. The function parameters implicitly default to undefined. Implicitly, without return statement, a JavaScript function returns undefined. We get undefined when accessing an array element with an out of bounds index</p>
